# SwiggyCase

This is a classic single vehicle pick-up and Delivery Problem with Time Windows. It can be proven that it is an NP Hard, and worst case time complexity is O(n<sup>2</sup>3<sup>n</sup>).

A forward dynmaic programming based algorithm has been implemented as discussed by [Desrosiers et al(1986)](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01966324.1986.10737198), and further surveyed by [Lakel et al(2016)](http://bora.uib.no/bitstream/handle/1956/15817/148682815.pdf?sequence=1)

As discussed in lietrature, because of constraints the average case complexity increases linearly with N(number of orders)
